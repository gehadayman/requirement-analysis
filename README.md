# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the requirement analysis phase of a software development project. It is part of a simulated project to build a Booking Management System and aims to provide a clear blueprint of how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and validated. The repository includes functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria to ensure the software is built in alignment with user and business needs.
